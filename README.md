# Discord Bot
A Discord bot written in C#

As of May 2019, I deleted one of the main(?) csproj files and I don't know if it'll compile with Visual Studio & Windows now. I currently use Linux and have given up with attempting to compile it for the Linux OS. This repository is an archive of this bot. Removed the music player function, as it was highly unorganized/unmodular, unfinished, and buggy.
