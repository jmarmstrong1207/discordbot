# Discord Bot
A Discord bot written in C#

As of May 2019, I deleted one of the main(?) csproj files and I don't know if it'll compile with Visual Studio & Windows now. I currently use Linux and have given up with attempting to compile it for the OS. This repository is an archive of this bot. 

This bot features a meme generator, and has a class that makes the creation of meme templates more streamline. It currently has two meme templates implemented. A GUI is included that has a window for chatlog and buttons to start/stop the bot.

I removed the music player, as it was buggy and it wasn't as modular as one would really liked.
