# DiscordBotSharp
A Discord bot written in C#

As of May 2019, I deleted one of the main(?) csproj files and I don't know if it'll compile with Visual Studio & Windows now. I currently use Linux and have given up with attempting to compile it for the Linux OS. This repository is an archive of this bot. It Features a 90% working music program that can queue and play YouTube videos and many other audio supported with youtube-dl. There are some bugs with the music queuing, etc. But like I said, this is currently an archive. Smaller commands are also included. The biggest part of this project was the music programming.
